# 10,000 (Ten Thousand) // Last Stand
## Pitch
Wo Long + Wuthering Waves + Ghost of Tsushima + Vampire Survivor + 20 Minutes to Dawn musou style game, where aggressively attacking and parrying the enemies allows you to cut through swaths of enemeis and breakdown overwhelming bosses. Death is always one hit away, but with the tools of the trade and excellent execution you can overturn the odds and survive the last stand.

## Tasks and Topics
I might be able to reappropriate the Xandering Dungeon Design into a sort of Xandering Sequence Design.

### TODO
3rd person player controller (parkour and martial arts movements)
Xandered Sequence Generator (Looped Levels vs One-Directional Plot Progression Graphs)
Level & Spawn Operators (extrapolating the Xandered Sequences)
AI/World State Machine (moment to moment state machine directing the active scenario)
