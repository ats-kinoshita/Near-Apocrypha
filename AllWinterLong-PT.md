# All Winters Long // Who are You to Me
## Pitch
An interactive fiction with a Sims-like simulated world. Given a Dark Academia aesthetic, gameplay is based on the Smart-Item and Utility-AI design patterns, with players listeing to the broadcasts of smart-entities that can reach them and 'opt-in' to chores to maintain physical, mental, and emotional vibrancy in this cut-throat institution.

## Tasks and Topics
This is an attempt to build my first independant game prototype, designing the entities, components, and systems to optimize for game feel and fun. My goal is to create a base interactive fiction engine that I can use in the future to quickly prototype and iterate on AI and "story generators".

### TODO
Define Entities-Components
Define Systems-Simulations
Define Update cycle
Define first-pass of camera/renderer
